## Hi there 🤙🏼

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ Years of experience based in New-York. I graduated from @BostonUniversity 🇺🇸 and @ECEParis 🇫🇷 in Computer Science and Information Systems.

I worked for @Vic-ai and Centre Sécurité Requin (Shark Detection) as Machine Learning Engineer.

I like coding and I am curious about: Problem solving, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, MLOps, Blockchain & keep discovering new stuff everyday 💡🧠
